[![View Presentation](https://img.shields.io/badge/Prezi_Presentation-Click_to_View-blue?style=flat-square&logo=prezi)](https://prezi.com/view/pKVziI47jyfyDhwvlBkc/)

This project presents the modeling, analysis, and control design of a **quadrotor** using classical linear control techniques.  
The objective is to stabilize and control the drone‚Äôs altitude and attitude through PD and PI/PD controllers, designed and validated in MATLAB and Simulink.

## üìò Project Overview

The goal of this project is to design and simulate a control system capable of stabilizing a quadrotor in hover mode.  
We used a **linearized state-space model** of the quadrotor and designed **PD controllers** for each control loop ‚Äî roll (œï), pitch (Œ∏), yaw (œà), and altitude (z).

The entire workflow includes system modeling, control design, simulation, and performance evaluation in MATLAB and Simulink.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Key Features

- **Linearized System Modeling:**  
  Derived a 12-state linear model around hover conditions, representing translational and rotational dynamics.

- **PD/PI Controller Design:**  
  Designed and tuned PD controllers using analytical methods (phase condition, root-locus) and MATLAB‚Äôs PID Tuner.

- **Stability and Frequency Analysis:**  
  Verified closed-loop performance using step response, Bode plots, Nyquist diagrams, and root locus analysis.

- **Simulink Implementation:**  
  Built a full control structure in Simulink, including dynamic modeling, feedback loops, and response visualization.

## üß© Modeling and Control Design

- **System Representation:**  
  The quadrotor dynamics were expressed in a **state-space form (A, B, C, D)**, capturing coupling between motion axes.

- **Control Strategy:**  
  Each motion channel was treated as a separate SISO subsystem. PD controllers were designed to achieve low overshoot and short settling time (<1s).

- **Simulation Setup:**  
  The system was implemented in Simulink with modular blocks for each controller and the dynamic model of the quadrotor.

## üìä Simulation and Results

The designed controllers successfully stabilized the system in all degrees of freedom.

- Step responses showed minimal overshoot and fast settling.  
- Frequency-domain analysis confirmed sufficient gain and phase margins.  
- Simulink simulations visualized stable hover and trajectory tracking.
